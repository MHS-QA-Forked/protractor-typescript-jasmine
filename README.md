# protractor-typescript-jasmine
Automation Test Framework using protractor, typescript and jasmine. 

Framework uses following libraries to automate
1. Protractor for browser automation
2. Typescript for writing test cases

NOTE: This is a work in progress framework. I will keep adding new features to the framework. Please add new feature requests. I will try to add them on priority.
